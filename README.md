#Question 1
->In the first question, I created a text file called administrative_data.txt.
  This text file has the data set in an order:
    1. Name
    2. Room No
    3. Telephone
    4. Position
    5. Email
I also created a cpp file to fetch the data from the text file.
    1. Ask for the name of the faculty member whose information he/she wants.
    2. Fetching the data from the text file.

#Question 2
->In this question, I have created a text file question2_data.text again.
  This text file has the data set in an order:
    1. Department
    2. Name
    3. Position
    4. Telephone
    5. Email
    6. Room number
I also created a cpp file to fetch the data from the text file.
    1. The user provides the department name as input.
    2. Fetching the department from the file and then selecting each faculty from the same department as mentioned by the user.

#Question 3
->We are creating a hierarchy model through which students' requests will proceed.
  I have mentioned four options to choose:
    1. Course Related
  	2. Course Guidance
    3. Registration related
    4. Other Academic Issues
  Each issue has a different hierarchical graph.
For example, in Course related queries, there are TAs/TFs, but in another query, they are not.
So, In this question, we have asked the user to choose the issue they have a problem with and then whether their issue got resolved or not. If not, then it will be redirected to the next level after wait of three days.
